                        I'm a data science enthusiast with a passion for transforming complex data into impactful insights.
                        Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Mechatronics Engineering, I focus on building intelligent systems that
                        blend machine learning, real-world data, and business understanding. My journey spans predictive modeling,
                        natural language processing, and creative problem-solving. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, disciplined learning,
                        and a mission to create solutions that matter.
